# Political_relational_management_software
I developed a python desktop application to collect data on electorates.
This enabled the user to track how well the electorates are tracking responding and device strategies based on learned knowledge from the data.
The application make use of SQL queries embedded in a python script.
A database was developed for each new entry and was updated accordingly.
